## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

**1. Prerequisites**
You need to have a local server installed, such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), with Apache and MySQL running.

**2. Download the code**
Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file. Place the entire folder inside your server directory (usually `C:\xampp\htdocs\Web`).

**3. Database Setup (Very Important!)**
This project requires a database to work.
- Open your XAMPP control panel and start **Apache** and **MySQL**.
- Go to your browser and open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
- Create a new empty database. You can name it whatever you like (e.g., `shopping_db`).
- Go to the **Import** tab in phpMyAdmin.
- Select the `database.sql` file located in the root of this repository and click Go/Import.

**4. Connect the code to the Database**
- Open the `config/database.php` file with any text editor.
- Make sure the database name (`$db_name`) matches the name you chose in the previous step.
- If you are using XAMPP, the default user is usually `root` and the password is left blank.

**5. Run the project**
Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/Web/` to start using the application!
